### H-Index
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

### Answer 
Sortthe papes first to be s[i]. 

Traverse from back until s[i] <= len - 1 - i

	class Solution {
	public:
	    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
	        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());
	        int len = citations.size();
	        for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; --i)
	        {
	            int h = len - 1 - i;
	            if (citations[i] <= h) return h;
	        }
	        
	        return len;
	    }
	};
